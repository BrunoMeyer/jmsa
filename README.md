# JMSA

Java Mass Spectrometry Analyzer is a free software to analyse of mass spectrometry to microorganism identification.

The software use MALDITOF mass spectra data generated by *flex series* (Bruker). There is a default algorithm that compute the similarity between spectres using the peaklist (peaks of spectres) information.
