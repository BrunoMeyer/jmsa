# JMSA

Java Mass Spectrometry Analyzer is a free software to analyse of mass spectrometry to microorganism identification.

The software use MALDITOF mass spectra data generated by *flex series* (Bruker). There is a default algorithm that compute the similarity between spectres using the peaklist (peaks of spectres) information. 

This project have the follow libraries as dependencies:

- [json-simple](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/)
- [jcommom](https://github.com/jfree/jcommon)
- [hierarchical-clustering-java](https://github.com/lbehnke/hierarchical-clustering-java)
